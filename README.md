**URLâ€‘Shortener with FastAPI, PostgreSQL & Redis Analytics ðŸš€**


**Overview**

A highâ€‘performance URL shortener service built with FastAPI and PostgreSQL, engineered for <5â€¯ms redirects, secure JWTâ€‘based authentication, and Redisâ€‘powered analytics capturing clickstream data (timestamps, geolocation) at scale (10K+ RPM).

The system is fully containerized with Docker, exposed via ngrok for public endpoints, and supports CI/CD through GitHub Actions, reducing deployment time by ~60%. A sleek React + Tailwind CSS frontend (bootstrapped with Vite) is in progressâ€”optimized for fast load times thanks to codeâ€‘splitting and cached Axios calls.



  **Backend Architecture & Features**

1.FastAPI-powered backend with asynchronous endpoints, delivering ultra-fast performance.

2.PostgreSQL as the primary relational data store, accessed via an async ORM (e.g. SQLModel / async SQLAlchemy).

3.JWT authentication system enables secure user registration, login, and tracking of click behavior.

4.URL redirection latency <5â€¯ms, measured endâ€‘toâ€‘end from request to redirect.

5.Redis-based analytics pipeline capturing clickstream events (timestamp, IP or geolocation, user agent, referrer), supporting 10K+ requests per minute.


 **DevOps & Deployment**

1.Dockerized services with individual Dockerfiles for backend, Redis, PostgreSQL, analytics.

2.Use of ngrok to expose local service tunnels for development and testing.

3.GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines handle build, test, docker-compose deploymentâ€”cutting deployment time by up to 60%.


 **Frontend (In Development)**

1.A modern UI under construction with:

2.React + Vite for fast builds and development.

3.Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.

4.Optimized for performance: code-splitting, caching, and responsive layouts.

5.Axios for API interaction with cached calls to reduce latency.

6.Aiming to reduce Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) by ~40% over a naÃ¯ve setup.

**Usage**
**Backend (Developers)**

cd backend

pip install -r requirements.txt

uvicorn app.main:app --reload

Use the /docs or /redoc endpoints for OpenAPI interfaceâ€”with endpoints for signup/login (JWT), create short URL, and redirect alias.


**Docker + ngrok**

docker-compose up --build

ngrok http http://localhost:8000


**CI/CD via GitHub Actions**

On each push to main, workflows run tests, lint, build containers, and deploy staging or production.

**Click Analytics**

1.Redis handles live ingestion of redirect events:

2.Each click event is enriched with timestamp and inferred geolocation.

3.Supports throughput of 10,000+ requests per minute with minimal latency overhead.

4.Analytics dashboard and aggregation queries supported (optional extension).


**Future Work (Roadmap)**

1.Frontend live previewâ€”create/customize short links.

2.Clickâ€‘analytics dashboard UI (charts, filters).

3.Admin/user dashboards, password recovery flow.
